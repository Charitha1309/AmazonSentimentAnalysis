Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
The Sentiment Analysis Project aims to analyze and categorize text data based on its sentiment. 
This application is designed to process customer feedback, reviews on Amazon Alexa and  categorizing
them into positive or negative sentiments. The project is built using Python and leverages 
machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to achieve accurate sentiment 
classification.

Key Features

--Data Preprocessing: Handles tasks like cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.
--Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics to understand data distributions.
--Model Building: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for training sentiment classifiers.
--API Integration: Exposes the sentiment analysis functionality via a RESTful API.
--Web Interface: A simple, intuitive interface for users to input text and view results.

Functionality

1.Data Exploration:
--Analyze and visualize text data.
--Understand patterns in positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

2.Model Training:
--Preprocess textual data using NLP techniques (e.g., stemming, lemmatization).
--Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or advanced models like Transformers.
--Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

3.API and Web Interface:
--api.py provides endpoints for real-time sentiment analysis.
--The templates directory houses web pages for user interaction.

4.Prediction:
--Accept user input (text) via the web or API.
--Return sentiment predictions instantly.
